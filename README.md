# Quizlet Bypass

So one evening, I got angry about quizlet locking their features behind a paywall, so I made this as fast as possible.

Please feel free to submit PRs for like adding an interface, improving the learning algorithm etc. as this is
currently in a rushed state.

## How to use

Open a terminal in the current folder and just run the `main.py` file with python. You may need to install packages
first:

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
python ./main.py
```
